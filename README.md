# Toll Management System using Blockchain

## Overview

The Toll Management System using Blockchain is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to streamline toll collection, reduce fraud, enhance transparency, and automate vehicle toll payments using blockchain technology. By leveraging smart contracts, the system ensures secure, immutable, and efficient toll transactions.

## Features

- 🚗 **Automated Toll Collection**: Vehicles are automatically charged upon passing toll points.
- 🔒 **Secure Transactions**: All toll payments and vehicle data are recorded on a tamper-proof blockchain ledger.
- ⚖️ **Transparent Auditing**: Real-time data and complete transaction history for audit and verification.
- 🧾 **Smart Contracts**: Rules and fee structures are encoded into smart contracts to ensure fair enforcement.
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Admin interface for monitoring toll stations, revenues, and vehicle entries.
- 🧠 **User Roles**: Separate modules for Admins, Toll Operators, and Vehicle Owners.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (for Ethereum) / Chaincode (for Hyperledger)
- **Frontend**: React.js / Angular
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express.js
- **Database**: IPFS / MongoDB (optional, for off-chain data)
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask (for Ethereum-based systems)

## Getting Started
